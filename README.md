# What is this?

This is a D3.JS Proejct where I make use of the d3-force package. So usually this package doesn't give the freedom for the users to locate their nodes, and even if we do manage to drag and change the positions, it resets back to its initial position on reload. So I've wrote some code to solve this problem :)
